    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how BJJ AI Journal ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our application.</p>

    <p>This data is not linked to your identity and is used solely to provide the AI coaching functionality. We do not store this data on our servers.</p>
